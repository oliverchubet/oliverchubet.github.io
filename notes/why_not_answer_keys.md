# Why not answer keys?

## Denying opportunities to grow:

1. Self reflection
1. Collaboration with peers
1. The ability to find information you need
1. The experience of solving difficult problems

## Draws the focus away from course content as a whole:

1. Try not to "overfit" to specific questions

## Suggestions for exam preparation:

1. Start early and review often instead of cram sessions
1. Know all textbook definitions (active recall)
1. Understand how to structure an argument
1. Try to solve related problems
1. Compare notes with peers
1. Come to office hours or ask questions on Piazza if you get stuck
1. Review homework feedback

## General:
- Learning isn't "convenient".
- There is no shortcut for gaining experience.
- You will be a better person for putting in the effort.
- There may not be a unique answer.
